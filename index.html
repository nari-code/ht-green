        <h1>Towards a zero electricity bill</h1>
        <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat 
            pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a 
            system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

        <h2>Solar PV Solutions</h2>
        <img src="/images/pv250.jpg" alt="" class="f-right">
        <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee 
            reliable cost-free power to your home or business. ROI is now taking less time 
            than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs and better technology. 
             
            If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion  
            chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further. 
             
            Call us now to discuss which solution is the best fit for your home. </p>

        <h2>Geothermal</h2>
        <img src="/images/geo250.jpg" alt="" class="f-right">
        <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than 
            the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution 
            to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round. 
             
            Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but 
            has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate  
            boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the 
            range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as  
            home heating. 
             
            Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the  
            earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.  
            As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming 
            if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

        <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
        <img src="/images/turbine250.jpg" alt="" class="f-right">
        <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a  
            wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a  
            wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation 
            potential. 
             
            New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine  
            works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed. 
             
            If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us, 
            contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.</p>

        <p>"We toyed with the idea of installing a hydro system a while back 
            and never got around to it but thanks to HT Green's Hydro Oasis  
            System it was easy! Our creek supplies our total energy needs."
